    <h3>Getting out of bed is a good idea.</h3>
    <p>You yawn and stretch, eventually sliding out of bed. Looking around your room, you see a number of items lying around:</p>
    <ul>
      <li onclick="suppliesClicked()">Your school supplies,</li>
      <li onclick="bluecardClicked()">Your BlueCard,</li>
      <li onclick="phoneClicked()">Your phone,</li>
      <li onclick="laptopClicked()">and your laptop.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(You can click on any of these to display extra text!)</p>
    <p id="suppliesHidden">It's a good idea not to forget your school supplies! You slide them into your backpack.</p>
    <p id="bluecardHidden">If you want to be able to get back into your dorm later, definitely don't forget this. You put it in your bag.</p>
    <p id="phoneHidden">A definite necessity, just in case. You put it in your bag.</p>
    <p id="laptopHidden">Not totally necessary, but definitely a good idea to have. You put it in your bag.</p>

I will create a site that contains a choose-your-own-adventure story. It will be not a terribly complicated one, but enough that it can engage the reader/visitor to the site.
The layout of the site will change based on the choices made -- if the person gets a bad ending, for example, the background will change to be red, and other similar things.

Steps:
  1. Basic HTML setup - basic layout of pages.
  2. Writing the story.
  3. Setting up different pages for every option, and links.
  4. Proofreading the story and making sure it makes sense.
  5. Integrating links and colors, moving the story to HTML.
  6. Quality assurance - manking sure it all works.
  7. Making sure that the site works and all CSS works well.
  8. Final presentation, allowing the class as a whole to pick the paths.

I don't see any major challenges, but staying on task and getting things done in a timely manner will be the most difficult part of this.
If I need help or input, I will ask someone that I know in the class, or email you directly.
